### Keep it minimal stupid

The unofficial Minimal Debian image

Maybe if you are looking for a minimal and no-nonsense Linux distribution, this might help.

Why did I build this? Yeah, because in some cases i need a very minimal, simple distribution for my machine that is still useful for my daily use.

> without stupid bloatware and unnecessary gimmick.

The image size is about 1-2GB.

## Installation

For installation you need to download the IMAGE first from [release](https://github.com/me-joe/Keep-it-minimal-stupid/releases). After that you can burn to your media like usual

Sfter boot into Desktop you can now navigate to `Application launcher` -> `Install debian`
