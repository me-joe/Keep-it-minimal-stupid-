### Keep it minimal stupid

The unofficial Minimal Debian image

Maybe if you are looking for a minimal and no-nonsense Linux distribution, this might help.

Why did I build this? Yeah, because in some cases i need a very minimal, simple distribution for my machine that is still useful for my daily use.

> without stupid bloatware.

because of that, we built an unofficial debian image with Minimal configuration.

The image size is about 1-2GB.
