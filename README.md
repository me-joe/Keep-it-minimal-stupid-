### Keep it minimal stupid

The unofficial Minimal Debian image

Maybe if you are looking for a minimal and no-nonsense Linux distribution, this might help.
Why did I build this? Yeah, because in some cases we need a very minimal, simple distribution that is still useful for daily desktop use. without stupid bloatware.

because of that, we built an unofficial debian image with Minimal desktop configuration.

The image size is about 1-2GB.

Desktop: Xfce
Office software: 0 (you can install it yourself using apt)
