### Keep it minimal stupid

The unofficial Minimal Debian image

Maybe if you are looking for a minimal and no-nonsense Linux distribution, this might help.

Why did I build this? Yeah, because in some cases i need a very minimal, simple distribution for my machine that is still useful for my daily use.

> without stupid bloatware and unnecessary gimmick.

The image size is about 1-2GB.

## Installation

For installation you need to download the IMAGE first from release tag. After that you can burn to your media like usual
